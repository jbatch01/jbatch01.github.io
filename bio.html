	<title>Biography Jeremy Batchelder</title>
</head>
<body> <p>My name is Jeremy Batchelder, from Kittery Point, Maine, and I am a junior. I plan to graduate in 2019 with a B.A. in Computer Science.
 
Two summers ago, I worked on a 7,000 acre cattle ranch in Jackson, Wyoming as a ranch hand and irrigator. I have also worked on a startup I found in September of my freshman year called Tusk Marketplace, an online marketplace for Tufts students to buy and sell their textbooks, furniture, and sublet apartments. I have held several roles within the company, from helping develop revenue channels to conducting market research. Recently, I have been spending a lot of time learning about payment systems, such as credit cards, near-field communication payments, and Bitcoin. I started a blog in 2014 called Small Money Big World and have been sharing some of my thoughts on FinTech and blockchain technology.

I grew up ski racing at Cannon Mountain in New Hampshire and enjoy spending my time outside. I am an avid mountain biker, and, if anyone is looking for a good book to read, I recommend Lonesome Dove and Nicholas Nassim Talebâ€™s writings.
