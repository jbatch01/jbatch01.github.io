	<p class="text_for_bio">My name is Jeremy Batchelder, and I am a junior at Tufts University. I am studying computer science.
Recently, I have been spending a lot of time thinking about and researching payment rails and blockchain technology. While this thought is not original, I believe that in the 5-7 years many of the major platforms we use to run the web, store our information, and conduct transactions will be on decentralized platforms. As we have scene recently, centralized databases are incredibly dangerous. They are a honeypot that once compromised are a liability to civilization. We also assume that many of the major companies that we use today will continue to act in benevolent ways that are consumers/citizens best interests. But this can always change. With decentralized systems, there is not a centralized database to hack or company that everyone needs to put their faith in.</p> 

<p class="text_for_bio">I am also very interested in seeing what the future of payments will hold. In most circumstances, we have to wait 2-3 days for a payment to be deposited/recieved while we can ship goods in less time.</p>  

<p class="text_for_bio">Two summers ago, I worked on a 7,000 acre cattle ranch in Jackson, Wyoming as a ranch hand and irrigator. I am currently working as a Venture Fellow for Rough Draft Ventures. I am interested in helping grow the entrepreneurial community at Tufts and connect interested students with the Greater Boston Ecosystem.</p>

<p class="text_for_bio">I am an avid mountain biker. If anyone is looking for a good book to read, I recommend Lonesome Dove and Nicholas Nassim Talebâ€™s writings.</p>
